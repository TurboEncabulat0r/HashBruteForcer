# HashBruteForcer
Might not be the fastest or most efficent, it was just a fun project i did at school. 


Right now all it does is hash every possible combination of 8 alphebetical characters
it dosent use numerical or special characters so its not a very useful hash breaker, it could be easily modified to use these so i might upate it in the future

to build it you should have g++ installed or something similar 
and run a command similar to this: 
`g++ main.cpp hash-library/sha256.cpp`

and to run it: 
`./a.out`
